MLOps.Day2
==============================
Small project in the striving of cleaner more friendly code.
To run install packages in requirements, preferebly in a conda env.
To prepare data run make data
To train model run make train
To clean project run make clean

To run any of the scripts otherwise, use the included python scripts with: `python /src/models/train.py filename outputname --flags`

# DockerCals
## Trainer - Img for training models and storing in model-folder
Build trainer image: `sudo docker build -f trainer.dockerfile . -t {name}:{version}`

Run trainer container: `sudo docker run --name {container_name} -v //$(pwd)/reports:/reports/ -v //$(pwd)/models:/models/ trainer:latest` 

-v calls to let it save to local storage. Needs to access a reports folder where a report is stored, and models folder, where the trained model is stored

## Validation - For checking how accurate a trained model is


## Prediction - For showing the predictions of a small sample-set
